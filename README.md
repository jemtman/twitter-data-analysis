# Ad Impression Analyzer for Twitter
Released 2022-11-23 under an MIT license. 

This notebook looks at targetting data for twitter ads.  To use it, you need to be able to run Jupyter notebooks, and also requires you to request, download, and unzip your twitter archive.  You can request your twitter archive in your Twitter settings.  Delivery, for me, took about a week. 

Once you have that downloaded and unzipped, put this file in your main archive directory and run all the cells below.  

Once you get to the section called "Let's actually do it", then you can run those cells as many times as you'd like to see the different results.

Please note, I am not a professional programmer, so this code likely has issues.  Mainly I'm releasing it after a few folk on Twitter (@jeffemtman) requested it.  If you see issues in my code, please LMK or help me improve it.
